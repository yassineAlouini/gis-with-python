Let's do GIS with Python
=========


Introduction
------------

This repo contains the "GIS with Python" notebook.


Abstract
--------

Letâ€™s do some GIS with Python!

Working with geolocated data can be a hard task. In fact,
between learning proprietary software (think Arcgis) and finding the best way
to integrate them with your current technology stack is no easy feat.
Fortunately, Python has a complete GIS stack that makes working with geolocated
data a breeze.
In this talk, I will quickly present the Python GIS stack and
how to use it to perform a simple data analysis. There will be a live
demo at the end of the talk.


Installation
------------

You will need version 3.5 (or more) of Python
