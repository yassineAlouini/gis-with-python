Introduction
------------

This repo contains the "Let's do some GIS!" notebook alongside code snippets used in the presentation.
The slides are `here <python_gis.pdf>`_ as well.


Abstract
--------

Letâ€™s do some GIS with Python!

Working with geolocated data can be a hard task. In fact,
between learning proprietary software (think Arcgis) and finding the best way
to integrate them with your current technology stack is no easy feat.
Fortunately, Python has a complete GIS stack that makes working with geolocated
data a breeze.

In this talk, I will quickly present the Python GIS stack and
how to use it to perform a simple data analysis. There will be a live
demo at the end of the talk.


Installation
------------

If you want ``geoplot``, you will need version 3.5 (or more) of Python.
Follow these instructions for the installation: http://www.residentmar.io/geoplot/installing.html

Otherwise, you can do ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` and work with Python 2.7.
